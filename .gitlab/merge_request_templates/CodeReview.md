## Code review checklist

* Is the Apache licence displayed clearly at the top of the file with the correct attribution?
* Am I able to understand the code easily?
* Does the code pass [rubocop linting](README.md#Linting) rules?
* Do classes have a single responsibility?
* Can I unit test / debug the code easily to find the root cause?
* Is the coupling between classes heavy?
