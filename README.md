label on issues that we feel are valuable to the project, but also a good size for people just starting out. If you're
keen have a look at this list and leave comments on any you'd like to try.

**FIXME** The instructions below here need some updating!

# Getting Started

This project is a super standard Ruby on Rails application that runs on Postgres
and Redis.

## Note On Local Development

For ease of development, this process describes how to configure your
environment to use a dockerized version of Postgres, Redis, and mailcatcher...
but there's no reason you can't just run those locally if you know what you're
doing. Consult your OS's package manager and docs for that

## Set up your environment

The instructions in this section assume you're on either macOS or Linux. All of
the tools exist for Windows, but the commands will differ somewhat (A PR to
update that would be welcome)

If you run into troubles getting any of this working, ask for help by
[raising an issue](https://github.com/ChicagoWorldcon/wellington/issues/new) and we'll be in touch!

From here onwards, we're assuming you're comfortable running commands in your console. These commands will create and install
files on your machine.

### Install docker for your platform

[docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Install interpreters and environment

To install and configure the ruby version used by Wellington:

```sh
brew install rbenv
rbenv install 2.7.1
rbenv local 2.7.1
```

Configuration for development should be done using whatever method you use for projects, but [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is probably the best one:

```sh
brew install direnv
```

After that step, follow the instructions for your shell to [hook direnv into
your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) or else it won't work

**Note:** if you intend to run the rails process directly in your shell (by
running `rails` commands directly) then `direnv` will be a godsend, as the
config won't otherwise read the `.env` file.

### Install basic developer tools.

1. [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/),
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Getting the source

Once you have these, clone this project using the git clone command with the URL you get from the clone button on the
top right of the page.

If you've been following or are planning to follow the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), make sure you use the
clone button on your fork of this project.

The command you run will end up looking something like this:

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:worldcon/wellington.git worldcon_members_area
```

This will create a directory named `worldcon_members_area` which you should run all the following commands from.

```sh
cd worldcon_members_area
```

### Setup direnv

Before installing dependencies, set up direnv so that they'll be installed to
project-local directories. Put this in the `.envrc` in the
`worldcon_members_area` directory:

```sh
# provide rbenv aliases in the project
use rbenv

# set up a local ruby GEM_HOME
layout ruby

# for some bonkers reason, GEM_PATH doesn't include the new GEM_HOME
path_add GEM_PATH $GEM_HOME

# webpacker and the JS tools need a node modules setup too
layout node

# this will automatically add `.env` to the working environment. Many
# of the keys in the .env template _must_ be present for the
# application to work
dotenv
```

- **Note 1**: If you choose not to use direnv's `ruby` layout, all of the
  `rails` and `rspec` commands below need to be prefixed with `bundle exec`.
  Direnv sets up local wrappers for you on those, which you will probably find
  a lot easier.\*

- **Note 2**: `.env` and `.envrc` fill different roles. `.env` is a simple
  KEY=VALUE file that docker will use to populate docker containers. Anything
  all of your docker containers should know goes in here. `.envrc` is for your
  development environment. It configures your local `GEM_PATH`, node modules,
  and tools. In addition, the example above sources `.env` so that running
  `rails server` will have the same environment as the docker containers.\*

### Install dependencies

Run these commands to install your ruby and node dependencies:

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
```

### Configuring the local system

You're going to need to setup a `.env` file to run this project. This is just a text file, and will keep your
configuration secrets out of source control. Here's an example to get you started!

```sh

```

If you're on production, please replace fields with your own values or the application will explode with copy pasta
errors ;-)

## Running the service during development

First, start your support services (redis, postgres, mailcatcher)

```sh
make start-support-daemons
```

You can stop these with `make stop` or reset them (tearing down
the DB) using `make reset`. You'll want to do this in particular if you change
the `WORLDCON_CONTACT` or `WORLDCON_THEME` variables, as both of those can
impact the DB tables created and seeded.

Next, start the actual rails application. In development mode it will run
sidekiq in the same process. In production you'll use the different entry points
and the two services will communicate via Redis.

```sh
rails server
```

Changes you make to your machine will show up inside the application which you can browse from http://localhost:3000

All emails sent from the website will be caught and displayed from http://localhost:1080, including login links and
receipts.

If you want to run up a console so you can get a seeded user with dummy reservations, you can do this with:

```sh
rails console
User.all.sample.email
```

A default support user is created as part of seeds. You should be able to sign in as this user by

1. navigating to http://localhost:3000/supports/sign_in
2. signing in with "support@worldcon.org", password 111111

If you need to install or upgrade dependencies, you can get a shell in your environment to run those commands

```sh
yarn upgrade
bundle update
```

If you want to run tests for the project you can do this by running

```sh
make test
```

This runs a lot of tests, but if you're mostly interested in the spec tests this will work better:

```sh
rspec
```

If you've finished working and want to shut down the servers, run

```sh
make stop
```

Cleaning up and starting your DB over from scratch looks like this:

```sh
make reset
```

Or you can go all the way and remove the docker containers, disks and networks:

```sh
make clean
```

From here you can delete the project files if you're done, or just run `make start-support-daemons` and everything will be built again
from scratch.

# Running in Production

**FIXME**: This is wildly out of date

We're taking advantage of Gitlab's CI pipeline to build docker images. You can browse our
[list of images](https://gitlab.com/worldcon/wellington/container_registry)
or just follow the `:latest` tag to get things that have gone through CI and code review.

To see all versions available, check out our [container registry](https://gitlab.com/worldcon/wellington/container_registry).
Git tags move `:stable`, merged work that's passed review moves `:latest`.

Below is an example setup which should get you most of the way towards a running instance.

CoNZealand has a few URLs, one for stable and one for master. Because staging traffic is minimal, the rails servers are
loaded onto the same AWS EC2 t2.micro instance using Ubuntu with
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Our database concerns are served by an AWS RDS db.t2.micro
which handles patching, backups and maintenance.

For an easy setup with SSL, conzealand uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) because it handles SSL with
[Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and is fairly quick.

Here's the CoNZealand compose file:

`~/docker-compose`

Here's the Cadyfile which handles SSL termination, transparent forwarding to our rails servers and http basic auth for
our staging setup:

`~/Cadyfile`

```

  errors stdout
  proxy / production_web:3000 {

  errors stdout
  basicauth / preview "yolo super secret password"
  proxy / staging_web:3000 {

}
```

```

There's also a `staging.env` next to this which is a variation on these settings. Make sure you use different variables
where possible, particularly `DB_NAME` and `REDIS_URL` options so you don't have clobbering data stores.

On your first run you're going to have to load in the database schema load and some seeds. You can do this from the
image itself by running up an interactive shell and using the rake commands available to that environment. Our database
seeds are stored in `db/seeds` and correspond to runnable rake commands.

Here's the basic recipe to load up a minimal conzealand production:

```
# Run an interactive shell
docker run --env-file=production.env registry.gitlab.com/worldcon/wellington:latest /bin/sh

# Create the database and load the schema
bundle exec rake db:create db:structure:load

# Seed your database
bundle exec rake db:seed:conzealand:production
```

# Tailoring to your Con

Our objective is to create a theme for Atlantis 2100, and set the theme and contact by modifying our .env with

```bash
WORLDCON_CONTACT=atlantis
WORLDCON_THEME=atlantis
```

To create a theme for your con, you'll need to:

1. Copy over layout, styles and app files from another con to get you started
   ```bash
   cp app/views/layouts/{conzealand,atlantis}.html.erb
   cp app/javascript/packs/{conzealand,atlantis}-app.js
   cp app/javascript/packs/{conzealand,atlantis}-styles.scss
   ```
2. Copy your favicon into app/javascript/packs/atlantis-favicon.ico
3. Modify app/views/layouts/atlantis.html.erb, change:
   - stylesheet_pack_tag to point at atlantis-app
   - javascript_pack_tag to point at atlantis-styles
   - favicon's resolve_path_to_image should point at media/packs/atlantis-favicon.ico
4. Open `app/lib/theme_concern.rb` and change `#theme_contact_form` to include a case for atlantis
5. Set `WORLDCON_CONTACT=atlantis` in your .env
6. Commit your work
7. Taylor styles.scss and layout.html.erb to suit your con

To create a model for your member contact form, you'll need to:

1. Create a database migration for your tables
   ```bash
   make bash
   bundle exec rails generate model AtlantisContact
   ```
2. Modify the `db/migrate/*_create_atlantis_contacts.rb` file, adding fields you need for your members.
   If you get stuck, use the `db/migrate/20191209052126_create_dc_contact.rb` migration and look up
   the guide on [Active Record Migrations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)
   from guides.rubyonrails.org.
3. Update
   - `app/models/atlantis_contact.rb` with constraints-- look at other \_contact models for reference
   - `spec/factories/atlantis_contacts.rb` with defaults-- look at other factories in this directory for examples
   - `spec/models/atlantis_contact_spec.rb` with tests if you've got logic in your model
4. Open `./app/lib/theme_concern.rb` and modify `#theme_contact_param` with `:atlantis_contact`
5. Copy over another con's form to get you started
   ```bash
   make bash
   cp app/views/reservations/_{conzealand,atlantis}_contact_form.html.erb
   ```
6. Modify fields in `app/views/reservations/_atlantis_contact_form.html.erb` to match your contact model.
   For reference, you can use the [Form Helpers guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)
   from guides.rubyonrails.org.
7. Set `WORLDCON_CONTACT=atlantis` in your .env
8. Run migrations with `bundle exec db:migrate` and commit all your work.

# Production Maintenance and Upgrades

If you're using the docker images, the Docker entry point uses `script/docker_entry.sh` which runs unapplied patches
with `rake db:migrate`. The schema will naturally change over time, for more information about migrations please see
the [Rails Migration](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html) docs.

The docker registry pumps out new images all the time. Here's a make file we're using to run updates on production:

`Makefile`

```make
default: update restart clean logs

ISO_DATE := $(shell date --iso-8601)

update:
	docker-compose pull

restart: stop
	docker-compose rm -f
	docker-compose up -d

logs:
	docker-compose logs -f

stop:
	docker-compose stop

clean:
	docker system prune -a -f

dump:
	# Requires a ~/.pgpass with 0600 based on https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/libpq-pgpass.html to run
	# Settings taken from https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home
	pg_dump -U postgres -h mydatabasepasta.lecopypastah.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com worldcon_production > production-$(ISO_DATE).sql
```

Note, the configuration above prefixes with. If you use spaces, it'll spray your terminal with errors.

Here's how you'd run your maintenance tasks

```bash
# Pull down the latest images, kick over the services and remove unused containers
make update restart clean

# Dump production SQL for offsite backup
make dump

# Watch production logs
make logs
```

# Configuring pricing

Pricing is handled through Membership records. Creating new records creates new memberships on the shop so long as
they're "active" at the current time. This is managed by setting `active_from` and `active_to` fields.

For instance, to create an Adult membership that varies in price over time, do this by running the following code:

```ruby
# Note, dates and prices are examples. Please don't expect these as a reflection on real dates/prices.
announcement = Date.parse("2018-08-25").midday
price_change = (announcement + 6.months).midday
venue_confirmation = Date.parse("2020-04-01").midday
Membership.create!(name: :adult, active_from: announcement, active_to: price_change price: 400_00)
Membership.create!(name: :adult, active_from: price_change, active_to: venue_confirmation price: 450_00)
```

Of course this is a bunch of effort, the real magic is doing this with seed files. To try this out on your local box,
you can always do this by chaining rake commands together. Development is a rif on production but with dummy data we'd
expect to see from our users such as filled out membership forms, or cast votes for Hugo.

Here's a few examples of you might reset your local database for a minimal setup:

```bash
# Chicago production, see db/seeds/chicago/production.seeds.rb
bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load db:seed:chicago:production

# Chicago development, see db/seeds/chicago/development.seeds.rb
bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load db:seed:chicago:development

# CoNZealand production, see db/seeds/conzealand/production.seeds.rb
bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load db:seed:conzealand:production

# CoNZealand development, see db/seeds/conzealand/development.seeds.rb
bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load db:seed:conzealand:development
```
