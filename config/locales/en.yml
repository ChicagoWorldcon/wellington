# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization

# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no

# Instead, surround them with single quotes.

        Eligibility to Nominate
        ----------------------------------------

        You may nominate for the 2020 Hugo Awards, the Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book, the Astounding Award
        for Best New Writer, if, on or before 31 December 2019, 11:59 PM PST

        * you are an attending or supporting member of CoNZealand (the 2020 World Science Fiction Convention), or
        * you were an attending or supporting member of Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon (the 2019 World Science Fiction
          Convention).

        Note: Young Adult memberships count as attending memberships and are eligible to nominate. Child memberships,
        one-day memberships and hall passes do not.

        Deadline
        ----------------------------------------

        All ballots must be received by Friday 13 March 2020, 11:59 PST

        How to Nominate
        ----------------------------------------

        You may nominate up to five persons or works in each category. However, if you are not familiar with the works
        that fall into that category, you are permitted (and encouraged) to make fewer nominations or none at all. Your
        nominations are equally weighted – the order in which you list them has no effect on the outcome.

        “No Award” will appear automatically in every single category on the final ballot – there is no need to include
        that choice on the nomination form.

        If your nominee is not well known, please provide a source where their 2019 work in that category may be
        found. This information makes it easier for us to identify the work you intend to nominate.

        If you make nominations for Best Series, it will help us if you also list a volume in the series that was
        published in 2019.

        Please note that nominations in the written fiction and dramatic presentation categories may be relocated to a
        different category by the Hugo Awards Administrator if close in length to the category boundary.

        If you have any questions about the process or need assistance with nominating, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:hugohelp@conzealand.nz">hugohelp@conzealand.nz</a>

        The Hugo Ballot containing the nominees in each category that qualified for the final ballot will be published
        by CoNZealand in April 2020. Only members of CoNZealand (including those who join after 31 December 2019) will
        be eligible to vote on the final ballot.  Please contact hugohelp@conzealand.nz if you have questions.

        Eligibility for Nominations
        ----------------------------------------

        Works published in 2019 for the first time anywhere are eligible for the Hugo Awards being awarded in 2020. So
        are works published for the first time in English translation in 2019, or for the first time in the United
        States in 2019, unless they have already appeared on a Hugo Award final ballot.

        Books are considered to have been published in the year of the publication date, which usually appears with
        the copyright information on the back of the title page. If there is no stated publication date, the copyright
        date will be used instead.  A dated periodical is considered to have been published on the cover date,
        regardless of when it was placed on sale or copyrighted.  Serialized stories or dramatic presentations are
        eligible in the year in which the last installment appears.

        Nominations may be relocated to a different category by the Hugo administrator if they are within 20% of the
        category boundary (such as in the case of Novel/Novella, Novella/Novelette, Novelette/Short Story, and
        Dramatic Presentation, Long Form/Dramatic Presentation, Short Form).

        For full eligibility rules, please see the
        [WSFS Constitution](http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WSFS-Constitution-as-of-August-19-2019.pdf).
