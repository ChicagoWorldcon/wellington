# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:

#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:

# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

        How to vote:
        ----------------------------------------

        * This ballot uses a modified version of the Single Transferable Vote for a single winner, sometimes known as the Alternative Vote or Instant Runoff Ballot.
        * To vote, mark your choices in each category in order of preference: “1” for first place, “2” for second place, and so on.
        * A lower preference is considered only if all the candidates ranked higher have been eliminated.
        * You are not required to rank all the finalists in any category.
        * If you leave any preference blank, preferences below that will not be counted, and if you leave your first preference blank, your vote will not be counted in that category at all.
        * If you decide not to vote in any given category, leave it blank.
        * Note that “No Award” is not an abstention. It means that none of the finalists should be given the award in question.
        * If you give preference votes to finalists below your ranking of No Award, your vote will count for those finalists if all higher-ranked preferences, including No Award, are eliminated.
        * When the ballots are counted, all the first place votes will be tabulated.
        * If no finalist receives more than half of the votes, the finalist with the fewest first place votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the finalists with the next preferences on those ballots.
        * This process of elimination of the last-placed finalist and redistribution of their votes to the next available preference continues until one finalist has more than half of all remaining votes, at which point that finalist becomes the winner (except under specific conditions described in Sections 3.6 and 3.12 of the [WSFS Constitution](http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WSFS-Constitution-as-of-August-19-2019.pdf)).

        Eligibility to Nominate
        ----------------------------------------

        You may nominate for the 2022 Hugo Awards, the Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book, the Astounding Award
        for Best New Writer, if, on or before 31 December 20, 11:59 PM PST

        * you are an attending or supporting member of #{convention_public_name} (the 2022 World Science Fiction Convention), or
        * you were an attending or supporting member of DisCon III (the 2021 World Science Fiction Convention).

        Note: Young Adult memberships count as attending memberships and are eligible to nominate. Child memberships,
        one-day memberships and hall passes do not.

        Deadline
        ----------------------------------------

        All ballots must be received by Friday 13 March 2022, 11:59 PM PDT

        How to Nominate
        ----------------------------------------

        You may nominate up to five persons or works in each category. However, if you are not familiar with the works
        that fall into that category, you are permitted (and encouraged) to make fewer nominations or none at all. Your
        nominations are equally weighted – the order in which you list them has no effect on the outcome.

        “No Award” will appear automatically in every single category on the final ballot – there is no need to include
        that choice on the nomination form.

        If your nominee is not well known, please provide a source where their 2021 work in that category may be
        found. This information makes it easier for us to identify the work you intend to nominate.

        If you make nominations for Best Series, it will help us if you also list a volume in the series that was
        published in 2021.

        If you have any questions about the process or need assistance with nominating, please contact us at
        <a href="%{mailto_hugo_help}">%{hugo_help_email}</a>

        The Hugo Ballot containing the nominees in each category that qualified for the final ballot will be published
        by %{worldcon_public_name} in April 2022. Only members of %{worldcon_public_name}  (including those who join after 31 December 2021) will
        be eligible to vote on the final ballot.  Please contact %{hugo_help_email} if you have questions.

        Eligibility for Nominations
        ----------------------------------------

        Works published in 2021 for the first time anywhere are eligible for the Hugo Awards being awarded in 2022. So
        are works published for the first time in English translation in 2021, or for the first time in the United
        States in 2021, unless they have already appeared on a Hugo Award final ballot.

        Books are considered to have been published in the year of the publication date, which usually appears with
        the copyright information on the back of the title page. If there is no stated publication date, the copyright
        date will be used instead.  A dated periodical is considered to have been published on the cover date,
        regardless of when it was placed on sale or copyrighted.  Serialized stories or dramatic presentations are
        eligible in the year in which the last installment appears.

        Nominations may be relocated to a different category by the Hugo administrator if they are within 20% of the
        category boundary (such as in the case of Novel/Novella, Novella/Novelette, Novelette/Short Story, and
        Dramatic Presentation, Long Form/Dramatic Presentation, Short Form).

        For full eligibility rules, please see the
        [WSFS Constitution](http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WSFS-Constitution-as-of-August-19-2019.pdf).

        Eligibility for Nominations
        ----------------------------------------

        Works published in 1946 for the first time anywhere are eligible for the Retro Hugo Awards being awarded in
        2022. So are works published for the first time in English translation in 1944, or for the first time in the
        United States in 1946, unless they have already appeared on a Hugo Award final ballot.

        Books are considered to have been published in the year of the publication date, which usually appears with the
        copyright information on the back of the title page. If there is no stated publication date, the copyright date
        will be used instead.  A dated periodical is considered to have been published on the cover date, regardless of
        when it was placed on sale or copyrighted.  Serialized stories or dramatic presentations are eligible in the
        year in which the last installment appears.

        Nominations may be relocated to a different category by the Hugo administrator if they are within 20% of the
        category boundary (such as in the case of Novel/Novella, Novella/Novelette, Novelette/Short Story, and Dramatic
