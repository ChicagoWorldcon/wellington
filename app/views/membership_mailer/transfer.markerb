Kia Ora!

You've received this email because <%= @detail || "somebody" %> has requested to transfer
membership #<%= @purchase.membership_number %>
from "<%= @from.email %>"
to "<%= @to.email %>"

While this transfer is happening, all rights for that membership are put on hold. After this transfer has completed, any
unused rights on that membership will belong to "<%= @to.email %>".

Each party has 7 days to complete this transfer, so this process may take up to 2 weeks to complete. If this doesn't
happen in time, then this transfer will be cancelled and "<%= @from.email %>" will continue to hold the membership.

Please follow one of the links below to proceed

* [transfer membership #<%= @purchase.membership_number %>](http://placekitten.com/200/300),
* or [cancel this transfer](http://placekitten.com/200/300).
