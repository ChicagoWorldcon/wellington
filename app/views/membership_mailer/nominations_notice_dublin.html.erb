  We are very glad to be able to tell you that nominations for the 2020 Hugo
  Awards and 1945 Retro Hugos are now open!

  As a member of Dublin 2019, you are eligible to nominate in the 17 Hugo ballot
  categories covering the best of the genre in the last year, for the Lodestar
  Award for Best Young Adult Book, the <em>Astounding</em> Award for Best New Writer
  (formerly known as the John W. Campbell Award), and for the 1945 Retro Hugos,
  celebrating the genre work of 1944.
</p>

<p>
  We have established nominations-only accounts for you within the CoNZealand system.

  To nominate online, please visit <%= link_to($hostname, $hosturl) %>,
  enter the email address you received this email at, and request a login link.
  We have established a nominations-only account for you within the CoNZealand
  system. After clicking the link and entering the members area, click on
  My Memberships to access all nominating accounts linked with that email
  address. Then click the nominating links on your account. Note that if you
  would like to upgrade to a supporting or attending membership in CoNZealand,
  you should do so within this interface so that your nominations stay linked
  to your membership.

    Please note that because voting is linked to your email address, everyone whose
    accounts are linked to this email address will be able to access and change
    nominations for all those accounts. To prevent this, we recommend that you
    transfer excess accounts to their own email addresses if possible. To do so,
    please send an email to hugohelp@conzealand.nz with details on which account
    you want to transfer, and the email address of the person to which it should be
    transferred. We recognize that this is not always possible. If you have
    multiple nomination-only accounts and/or CoNZealand memberships under your
    email address, please remember that Hugo voting and nominating rights are
    attached to a person NOT a membership, so you should only nominate once, for
    your own membership/account.
  </p>

<p>
  You can choose up to five nominees in each category. Be sure to hit the save
  button once you have made your nominations. You can save each category
  individually, or save them all at once using the button at the bottom of the
  ballot. You can make as many changes as you like to your nomination ballots
  until the deadline. Your current ballot will be emailed to you an hour after
  you stop making changes to it.
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for nominations is 13 March 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific Daylight Time
  (2:59 am Eastern Daylight Time, 06:59 Irish time, and 8:59 pm 14 March 2020 New
  Zealand time). Although members of Dublin 2019 can nominate, only members of
  CoNZealand will be eligible to vote on the final ballot and choose the winners
  of the 2020 Hugo, Lodestar and <em>Astounding</em> Awards and the 1945 Retro Hugo
  Awards.
</p>

<p>
  We expect to announce the final ballot in early April, and the awards will be
  presented at CoNZealand, which will run from July 29 to August 2, 2020.
</p>

<p>
  The Hugo Awards are fan-run, fan-given, and fan-supported. We recommend that
  you nominate whatever works and creators you have personally read or seen that
  were your favorites from 2019.
