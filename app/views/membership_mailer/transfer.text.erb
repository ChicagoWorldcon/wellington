<%= @worldcon_greeting_sentence_excited %>

You've received this email because <%= @owner_name || "somebody" %> requested to transfer
membership #<%= @membership_number %>

From: "<%= @from %>"
To: "<%= @to %>"

This transfer has now taken effect. Both parties will have received this email.

If this transfer was performed in error, or you have questions, please reply to this email
or email <%= $member_services_email %>.

For the recipient of this transfer, at this point, you are able to access the membership
through our registration portal at <%= reservations_url =%>


Use your email address where it asks you to enter an email address for a login link. It can
take up to 30 minutes for emails to be generated (although it is usually faster).
Some email providers may inadvertently mark the email as spam, so please check your spam
folder as well.


Once logged-in, you'll see a menu on the left that includes the choice "My Memberships."
Click on that.


This will pull up a screen that has your membership details. Please review the details on
the right that include your address, email, and other choices. At the bottom, there will be
an option to save your changes.


At the top of that area, there is a white box to the left. Within that box, you will find
your options to nominate for the Hugo Awards and to do any voting once those abilities are
turned on in the system. You will also see the option to upgrade your membership if you
need to do so at any point in the future.


Please let us know if you have any questions! And welcome to <%= @worldcon_public_name %>!

Thank you
