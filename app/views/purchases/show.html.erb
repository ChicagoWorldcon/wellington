        <h2>Attending Membership</h2>

        <p>
          An Attending Membership is for people who can attend the convention physically.
          There are a number of different types of Attending Memberships.
          Attending Memberships are all inclusive.
          You do not have to pay anything more for autographs, attendance to panels, dances and so on.
          Note that some external events that are affiliated with, but not organised by, CoNZealand may have extra fees.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will receive all our publications.
          This also comes with the right to nominate and vote in the Hugo Awards in 2020.
          You can also vote in Site Selection for the 2022 Worldcon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: Kid In Tow does NOT come with voting rights in the Hugo Awards or Site Selections.
        </p>

        <h2>Supporting Membership</h2>

        <p>
          A Supporting Membership is for people who cannot attend the convention physically.
          You will receive all our publications.
          This also comes with the right to nominate and vote in the Hugo Awards in 2020.
          You can also vote in Site Selection for the 2022 Worldcon.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can always upgrade your supporting membership to attending memberships, at the price difference at the
          time.
        </p>

        <h2>Membership Transfer</h2>

        <p>
          We are happy to fully transfer a membership to another person.
          The person wanting to transfer, and the person receiving the transfer need to contact us at
          <a href="email:registrations@conzealand.nz">registrations@conzealand.nz</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The transfer is of all rights that go along with that membership. If any of those rights have been exhausted,
          eg. by nominating or voting in the Hugos, then those rights are not available anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the transferer wants to then be a supporting member in order to get rights for Hugo nominations, voting
          and Site Selection, then they will need to take out a fresh supporting membership.
