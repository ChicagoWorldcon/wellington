  Hello eligible Hugo nominator! This is just a quick reminder to let you know
  that the end of the Hugo nomination period is fast approaching! The deadline
  for nominations is 13 March 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific Daylight Time (2:59 am
  Eastern Daylight Time, 06:59 Irish time, and 8:59 pm 14 March 2020 New Zealand
  time).
</p>

<p>
  As a member of Dublin 2019, you are eligible to nominate in the 17 Hugo ballot
  categories covering the best of the genre in the last year, for the Lodestar
  Award for Best Young Adult Book, the Astounding Award for Best New Writer
  (formerly known as the John W. Campbell Award), and for the 1945 Retro Hugos,
  celebrating the genre work of 1944. Although members of Dublin 2019 can
  nominate, only members of CoNZealand will be eligible to vote on the final
  ballot and choose the winners of the 2020 Hugo, Lodestar and Astounding Awards
  and the 1945 Retro Hugo Awards. If you would like to vote, you can purchase a
  membership to CoNZealand from your nominating account.

  We expect to announce the final ballot in early April, and the awards will be
  presented at CoNZealand, which will run from July 29 to August 2, 2020.

  The Hugo Awards are fan-run, fan-given, and fan-supported. We recommend that
  you nominate whatever works and creators you have personally read or seen that
  were your favorites from 2019 and 1944.
