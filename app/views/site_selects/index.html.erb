          In order to vote in site selection for the <%= worldcon_year.to_i+2 %> Worldcon, you must purchase an Advance Supporting Membership
          for the eventual winner of the site selection vote.
        <p>
          This payment, which is also refered to as the Site Selection Fee, will give you a supporting membership in whichever Bid is selected to host the 
          <%= worldcon_year.to_i+2 %> Worldcon.  This payment grants you a supporting membership in the winning bid, even if you choose not to vote.
        <p>
          Once you payment is processed, you will be given a code to write on your site selection ballot.  You may return to this page at any time to retreive your code.
          This code is granted only to this membership.
        <p> 
          By making this payment, you agree that your information will be given to the winner so that they may process your supporting membership. 
          You may later convert your supporting membership into an attending membership. 
        <p>  
          All site selection payments will be processed by DisCon III, but all proceeds will be given to the winning bid.  
          The site selection fee is US$ 50.00, as agreed to by the bid teams.
        <p>
          Instructions for voting can be found here. 
          Ballots can be sent via email to worldcon81ballot@discon3.org or paper mail to (include PO box). Ballots can not be changed once submitted.

          Once your payment has been processed, you can return to this page to see your Site Selection token, which must be entered on your ballot.
