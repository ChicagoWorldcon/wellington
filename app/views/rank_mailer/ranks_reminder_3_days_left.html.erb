  The deadline for Hugo voting is only 3 days away. Please do not wait until the last minute to start voting
  - sometimes there are hiccups in the login process, and it can take our team
  some time to fix those for you. So if you plan to vote and have not logged
  in and accessed the voting form yet, please do so ASAP. The deadline for
  voting is <%= localize($hugo_closed_at.in_time_zone("Pacific Time (US & Canada)"), :format => :long) %> Pacific Daylight Time
  (<%= localize($hugo_closed_at.in_time_zone("Eastern Time (US & Canada)"), :format => :short) %> Eastern Daylight Time,
  <%= localize($hugo_closed_at.in_time_zone("Europe/Dublin"), :format => :short) %> Irish time,
  and <%= localize($hugo_closed_at.in_time_zone("Wellington"), :format => :short) %> New Zealand time).
</p>

<p>
