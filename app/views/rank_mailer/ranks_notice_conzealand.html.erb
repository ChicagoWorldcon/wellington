  We are very glad to be able to tell you that voting for the 2020 Hugo
  Awards and 1945 Retro Hugos is now open!
</p>

<p>
  As a member of CoNZealand, you are eligible to vote in the 17 Hugo ballot
  categories covering the best of the genre in the last year, for the Lodestar
  Award for Best Young Adult Book, the <em>Astounding</em> Award for Best New Writer
  (formerly known as the John W. Campbell Award), and for the 1945 Retro Hugos,
  celebrating the genre work of 1944.
</p>

<p>
  To vote online, please visit <%= link_to($hostname, $hosturl) %>,
  enter the email address you received this email at, and request a login link.
  After clicking the link and entering the members area, click on My Memberships
  to access all memberships linked with that email address. Then

  <p>
    Please note that because voting is linked to your email address, everyone whose
    memberships are linked to this email address will be able to vote for all
    those memberships. To prevent this, we recommend that you transfer
    excess memberships to their own email addresses if possible. To do so,
    please send an email to

    <%= link_to($member_services_email, "mailto:#{$member_services_email}") %>

    with details on which membership you want to transfer, and the email
    address of the person to which it should be transferred. We recognize that
    this is not always possible. If you have multiple memberships under your
    email address, please remember that Hugo voting rights are
    attached to a person NOT a membership, so you should only vote once,
    for your own membership.

  </p>
<% end %>
<p>
  You can rank up to six works in each category. Be sure to hit the save
  button once you have cast your votes. You can save each category
  individually. You can make as many changes as you like to your voting ballots
  until the deadline. Your current ballot will be emailed to you an hour after
  you stop making changes to it.
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for voting is 15 July 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific Daylight Time
  (2:59 am Eastern Daylight Time, 06:59 Irish time, and 8:59 pm 16 July 2020 New
  Zealand time).
