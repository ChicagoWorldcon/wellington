We’re glad to see that you’ve chosen to participate in selecting the location of
the <%= @election_info[:name] %>.  You may cast your ballot either by sending one
through the mail, carrying it in person to Chicon 8, having a friend carry it in
for you, or voting online through ElectionBuddy.  If you forget to vote, we will
treat your payment as a “No Preference” ballot, and you will still receive a
supporting membership in the winning convention.

You can find the paper ballot on our website at: https://chicon.org/home/for-members/site-selection/

You can find the ElectionBuddy vote at: <%= @election_info[:link] %>

Regardless of which method of voting you choose, you will need to provide your
Voting Token.  If you vote via ElectionBuddy, you will also need your voter ID.

These are as follows:

Voter ID: <%= @voter_id  %>
Voting Token: <%= @token %>

Please contact us at siteselection@chicon.org if you have any questions regarding voting,
and thank you for participating in this year’s site selection process.
