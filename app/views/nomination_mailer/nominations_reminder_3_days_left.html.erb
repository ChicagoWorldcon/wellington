  Hello eligible Hugo Award nominator! The deadline for nominations for the 2022 
  Hugo Awards, the Lodestar Award for best Young Adult Books, and the <em>Astounding</em>

  some time to fix those for you. So if you plan to nominate and have not logged
  in and accessed the nomination form yet, please do so ASAP. The deadline for
  nominations is <%= @hugo_nom_deadline %>.
