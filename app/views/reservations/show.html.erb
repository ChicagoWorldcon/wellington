          <p>
            We are happy to fully transfer a membership to another person.
            The person wanting to transfer, and the person receiving the transfer need to contact us at
            <a href="email:registrations@conzealand.nz">registrations@conzealand.nz</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            The transfer is of all rights that go along with that membership. If any of those rights have been exhausted,
            eg. by nominating or voting in the Hugos, then those rights are not available anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the transferer wants to then be a supporting member in order to get rights for Hugo nominations, voting
            and Site Selection, then they will need to take out a fresh supporting membership.
