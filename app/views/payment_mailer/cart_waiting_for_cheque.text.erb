We've sent you this email to confirm your online order of <%= @transaction_date %>.

Your order includes:

  <% @item_descriptions.each_with_index do |desc, i| %>
    <%= i + 1 %>.  <%= desc %>
  <% end %>

You still need to pay a total of <%= number_to_currency(@outstanding_amount) %> to cover this order.  In order to fully claim your <%= pluralize(@item_count, 'item') %>, please send us a cheque or other non-cash payment in USD at:

<%= worldcon_registration_mailing_address %>

IMPORTANT: Please include the following information with your payment:

1.  Your email address
2.  Your order number: <%= @order_number %>

You can also do this any time by returning to the members area to pay your membership off completely.

Also, if you are interested, installment plans are currently under development.  The Finance Division will be emailing information about how the plans work as soon as they are finalized.  There will be no installment payments due prior to January 2021.
