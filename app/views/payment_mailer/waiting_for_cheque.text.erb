We've sent you this email to let you know that we have your <%= @reservation.membership %> membership reserved as membership number #<%= @reservation.membership_number %>.

You still need to pay <%= @outstanding_amount %> to cover this membership.  In order to fully claim it, please send us a cheque or other non-cash payment in USD to:

<%= worldcon_registration_mailing_address %>

You can also do this anytime by returning to the members area to pay your membership off completely.

Also if you are interested, installment plans are currently under development.  The Finance Division will be emailing information about how the plans work as soon as they are finalized.  There will be no installment payments due prior to January 2021.
