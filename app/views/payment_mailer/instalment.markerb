Kia Ora <%= @detail.playful_nickname %>!

We've sent you this email to let you know that we've just received an instalment towards your
<%= @reservation.membership %> membership, which is reserved with the membership number #<%= @reservation.membership_number %>.

You paid <%= @charge.amount.format(with_currency: true) %> which will show up on your statement with the
identifier "<%= @charge.stripe_id %>" and will appear to be going out to "CoNZealand".

You still need to pay <%= @outstanding_amount %> to cover this membership. You can do this anytime by returning to the
members area and to make further instalments or to pay your membership off completely.
