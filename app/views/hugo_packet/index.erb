          Welcome to the Hugo Voter’s Packet for <%= worldcon_year %>! Please take a moment to read this 
          introduction before accessing the materials. 
        <p>
          This download of materials from Hugo Award finalists is supplied free of charge as a courtesy by creators, publishers and studios.
          The purpose is to allow those who are voting on the Hugo Awards to be able to make an informed choice among the finalists
          We are deeply appreciative of the publishers, studios, authors, artists, editors, and other creators who have generously provided
          their works to this year’s Hugo Voter Packet. We also ask that you honor publishers’ and creators’ request that you reserve these
          copies for your personal use only, and that you do not share these works with non-members of <%= worldcon_public_name %>.
        <p>
          We have divided the packet into categories for ease of downloading. For each category you will see a .pdf file, which contains a list of content
          for that category, and a .zip file, which contains the material submitted by the finalists.
        <p>
          Some parts of the packet are quite large! Time your bandwidth usage accordingly. Specifically, the Best Fancast, Best Graphic Story, Best Semiprozine,
          and Best Series are on the larger side. Note that when you click on the link, the download will start automatically.
        <p>  
          For the Astounding Award and Lodestar Award, some written material uses Net Galley widgets (a widget looks like a link.)
          These links will be in the .pdf of the work.
          In each Table of Contents for the categories,
          we have indicated when a work has a Net Galley widget. Net Galley is a free service that allows you to download different copies of a work.
          You must first register for an account and then come back to the link in the .pdf and click on it to access the work. These links will expire when voting closes.
        <p>
          We do have materials in every category this year, including both dramatic presentation categories and Best Video Game.
          Rather than have you download videos, we have provided links to password-protected videos online.
          Please do not share the links or passwords. For Best Video Game, some studios have provided us with a way for you to play their finalist game;
          you will need to read the notes for individual games to find out how to access these codes, which may be limited. 
        <p>
          We hope you enjoy the content of the Hugo Voter Packet. Please remember to download any materials and finalize your ballot 
          choices by November 19th, 11:59 PM PST.
          The voter packet will be removed when voting closes. If you have any problems with the packet, please contact <%= email_hugo_help %>.
