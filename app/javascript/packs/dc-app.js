// To reference this file, add <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %> to the appropriate
// layout file, like app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

// Uncomment to copy all static images under ../images to the output folder and reference

// or the `imagePath` JavaScript helper below.

// Rails defaults
// Register theme with webpacker, allows us to use styles with stylesheet_pack_tag
