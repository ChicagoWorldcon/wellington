# The ChargesController presents a way for customers to pay money through stripe. On successful or fialed payment,
# we create Charge objects to track what happened and list them against the Reservation.
#
# Note, even if a Reservation is transferred to antoher user, a Charge will always be against the original user that
# it was made out to.

    # 1. create a token or source on the client
    # 2. then passed it to your server to create a charge.

    # 1. create a Session on your server, pass its ID to your client
    # 2. redirect your customer to Checkout
    # 3. they then gets redirected back to your application upon success.
