This patch introduces a new required environment variable.
It also requires production to have Stripe webhooks configured
against the checkout.session.completed and checkout.session.expired
events. That configuration should be completed prior to deploy.

For production, webhooks can be configured using:
https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

The webhook will need to point to https://PRODUCTION_HOST/stripe_webhook
Webhook events are opt-in, so make sure to include both
checkout.session.completed and checkout.session.expired.

After configuring the webhook, you'll want to shove its signing secret
into the STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET environment variable.

For local testing, you can test Stripe webhooks using the Stripe CLI
and the stripe listen command.
